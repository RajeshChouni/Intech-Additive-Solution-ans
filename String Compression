This code is implementing a simple compression algorithm that compresses a string by replacing consecutive repeated characters with a single occurrence of the 
character followed by the number of times it is repeated. For example, "aaaabbcddddd" becomes "a4b2c1d5".

In terms of memory usage, the code does not use any dynamically allocated memory and the string is passed as a value to the function. The only memory used is that
required by the string and the integer variables used to keep track of the repetition and index of the current character.

I am comfortable in Java, In Java, the string is an immutable object, which means that it cannot be modified once it is created. Therefore, a different approach is needed to implement this
algorithm in Java. One way to do this is to use a StringBuilder object to build the compressed string.

Here is the modified code in Java that uses StringBuilder:


public class StringCompression {
    public static void compress(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int num = s.length();
        int i = 0;
        while (i < num) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            int repetition = 1;
            while (i < num - 1 && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                repetition++;
                i++;
            }
            sb.append(c);
            sb.append(repetition);
            i++;
        }
        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "aaaabbcddddd";
        compress(str);
    }
}


In this code, a StringBuilder object is used to build the compressed string. The character and its repetition count are appended to the StringBuilder object in each 
iteration of the while loop. Finally, the compressed string is obtained by calling the toString() method on the StringBuilder object.

This approach reduces the memory usage compared to the original code as it does not create any temporary string objects. The StringBuilder object allocates memory 
dynamically as needed to store the compressed string.
